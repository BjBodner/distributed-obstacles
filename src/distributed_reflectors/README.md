# distributed-reflectors
An environment for simulated the propogation of non interacting particles through an environment of zero-width, line-like reflectors.

This enables efficient computation, using exact collision detection and reflection calculations.
Furthermore, the envorinment uses sparse computations over relevant particles.
Lastly, all computations are vectorized using the numpy library.

The factors discribed above enable fast propogation of a large number of particles through the system.
